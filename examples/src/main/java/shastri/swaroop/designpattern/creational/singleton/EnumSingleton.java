// To overcome this situation with Reflection, Joshua Bloch suggests the use of Enum to implement
// Singleton design pattern as Java ensures that any enum value is instantiated only once in a Java program.
// Since Java Enum values are globally accessible, so is the singleton. The drawback is that the enum type
// is somewhat inflexible; for example, it does not allow lazy initialization.
